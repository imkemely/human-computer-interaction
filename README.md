## Project Deliverables

### 1. About
This section provides an overview of the project, its goals, and how the design principles of HCI have been applied throughout.

### 2. Research
- **Objective**: To understand the needs and behaviors of the target users.
- **Method**: A combination of user interviews, surveys, and market research.
- **Outcome**: Insights into user pain points, goals, and potential design improvements.

### 3. Personas
We created personas to represent our target users, helping guide design decisions by focusing on real user needs. These include:


### 4. Scenario
A scenario that demonstrates how a user would interact with the system to achieve a specific goal, illustrating how our design addresses user needs.

### 5. Storyboard
A visual representation of the user flow, depicting key interactions users will have with the website.

### 6. Moodboard
A collection of images, colors, and design elements that inspired the visual style of the website.

### 7. Flowchart
A detailed flowchart that maps the overall structure and user navigation paths within the website.

### 8. Wireframes
Early-stage sketches of the website layout, representing the basic structure of the pages and user interactions.

### 9. GUI
Final graphical user interface designs, including interactive elements, buttons, and other visual components, with a focus on accessibility and usability.

### 10. Prototype
An interactive prototype created to test the user experience. This allows us to gather feedback and iterate on design choices.

### 11. References
A list of all academic papers, books, and other resources used throughout the project.
